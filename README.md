The code in provided in Sample_spider.py file and output.json contains the output for the code.
The output contains the following:
Title, author, publication_date, reading_time, content, comments

I have included a jupyter notebook file containing the code and output but due to scrapy being 
unable to run on jupyter notebook, I have ran it on VS Code, and additionally provided the entire project file
from VS Code called webscraping_task.
